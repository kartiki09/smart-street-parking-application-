# 🚗 Smart Street Parking Application

A software-based smart parking management system designed to provide real-time visibility of street and residential parking availability without relying on hardware sensors.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Urban areas face challenges such as traffic congestion, illegal parking, and time wastage due to lack of real-time parking information. Finding vacant parking spaces in streets and residential areas is inefficient and frustrating.

## 💡 Solution Overview
This project proposes a **software-only smart parking system** where users can:
- View parking areas and slot availability
- Reserve available parking slots
- Receive confirmation notifications to verify continued parking
- Use the system even during poor internet connectivity with offline support

The system relies on **user confirmations and smart notifications** instead of hardware sensors, making it cost-effective and scalable.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Area-wise parking slot visibility
- Color-coded slot status (Available / Reserved / Occupied)
- Slot reservation with confirmation modal
- Offline action handling and auto-sync
- Notification-based parking status confirmation
- Hardware-free, software-only approach

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team Contributions
- **Member 1:** Authentication & app shell
- **Member 2:** Parking area selection, slot UI, reservation logic
- **Member 3:** Offline support, synchronization logic, confirmation notifications

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
